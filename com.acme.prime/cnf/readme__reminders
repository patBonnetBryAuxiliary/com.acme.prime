  Reminder about OSGi development :
  *********************************
  Modular applications are made of an aggregate of interacting bundles, 
  where each bundle satisfy the OSGi specifications. An OSGi bundle is a jar
  that embeds its class-files and resources in a structured way, as well as
  a MANIFEST file which must complies with the OSGi specifications,
  i.e. containing the required OSGi meta-data.
  The process of developing (assembling) an OSGi bundle is driven by the 
  MANIFEST file.
  
  Reminder about developing with Bndtools :

  The underlying maker tool for an OSGi bundle is bnd, a command-line tool.
  Bndtools, an Eclipse-IDE plug-in, is a powerful and productive way to
  develop with OSGi, based on bnd. Bndtools automates the overall processes
  of building the bundle, i.e. assembling the jar and synthesizing the MANIFEST
  file by managing calls to bnd, passing to it the required command arguments.
  - Remind that for bnd, a command is given as an argument to the call to bnd,
    and that a list of bnd commands can be passed using a properties file, where
    each property triggers a specific bnd command.
  - Remind also that to comply with OSGi specifications, the MANIFEST file must
    contain some OSGi specific meta-data.
  In addition to the general meta-data a MANIFEST file of a java jar bundle must
  possess, the meta-data specific to OSGi are obviously also managed by bnd,
  which means that additional properties file(s) are required for them.
  
  Under Bndtools, a bnd project is driven by the bnd.bnd file or by a
  hierarchical tree of *.bnd files whose parent is bnd.bnd.
  The purpose of bnd.bnd (and optionally its hierarchy) is precisely to control
  the OSGi aspects of the bundle in development, e.g. the bundle version, which
  packages should go into the bundle, what is exported, imported, capabilities,
  and other requirements ...
  Furthermore, bnd.bnd contains also some properties not related to the targeted
  bundle content but to make bnd configuring other aspects of the project like
  the build path, the test path, the run configuration, etc...  

  Using the BndTools editor, we can manipulate the *.bnd file through a set
  specialized HMI forms tabs. The overall result can be consulted in the
  "Source" tab of this editor. It is also possible to edit directly the
  *.bnd file in this "Source" tab.
  
  Remind that, unlike developing with PDE (Plugin-Development-Environment), the
  default build-path of a bnd project is set to the strict minimum (the JRE
  System Library). Consequently, any other bundles to which the current bnd
  project need to be linked must be explicitly added to the project build path
  for compilation.
  
  Another important point :
  Pay attention to the false-friends with the bnd project editor.
  In this exercise (com.acme.prime.eval.provider), when dragging the
  API package (com.acme.prime.eval.api) from the 'calculated imports' tab to the
  'Export packages' tab, then saving, com.acme.prime.eval.api disappears
  from the 'calculated imports' tab, this doesn't mean that it will no more
  be imported.
  See the MANIFEST of the generated bundle (com.acme.prime.eval.provider.jar)
  and check that the API package (com.acme.prime.eval.api) is either exported and
  imported, which indicates that a copy of com.acme.prime.eval.api package is now
  embedded in the com.acme.prime.eval.provider bundle, this also means that this
  embedded API package is exported under the precise semantic-version of the
  original. The 'Import-Package' statement also implies that once our provider
  bundle will be active, the running OSGi framework may link it to another 
  (and obviously separate) installed bundle exporting the API package (in our
  exercise it can be the com.acme.prime.eval.api bundle).
  To occur, this situation implies that the running OSGi framework had resolved
  that the semantic-version number of the com.acme.prime.eval.api API package
  exported by the separate bundle is compatible with the version-range specified
  by the 'version' attribute of the related 'Import-Package' statement in our
  provider bundle.
  This implies also that, in this situation, the provider bundle exports the
  API package it imports.
  See OSGi in action...
