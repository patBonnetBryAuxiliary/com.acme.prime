  The "Quick-Start tutorial" working-set brings together the different OSGi bundle
  projects related to the eponymous OSGi-enRoute tutorial
################################################################################
  Description :
  
  In this quick start we develop a little project that, creates a single page
  web-application. This 'application' will provide a web user interface based on
  Google's Angular JS and Twitter’s Bootstrap. We will use the OSGi enRoute
  built-in template since this is setup to provide exactly that.
  This tutorial is light on the explanations because it focuses on introducing
  the overall architecture of enRoute, not the details.
  
  - So, this 'application' provides a simple web-page, served by Jetty, located
    on the local-host at port HTTP:8080
    This web-page serves as a user-interface. Once launched in the OSGi framework,
    we can open it with the web-browser, clicking :
       http://localhost:8080/com.acme.prime.upper
    if we'are asked for credentials, type :
      User id: 	admin
      Password:	admin   
    
  - Furthermore, in the 'debug' phase of this tutorial (see OSGi details
    in section "Creating an application) we will additionally make the
    OSGi framework running an Apache-Felix-Web-Console to debug the bundles.
    We can open it with the web-browser, clicking :
      URL : http://localhost:8080/system/console/xray
    if we'are asked for credentials, type :
      User id: 	admin
      Password:	admin

  Related bundle project at time of first time exercising this section of the
  tutorial :
    com.acme.prime.upper.application
  
  or
  
  Related bundle projects once the "Exercise services" section of this tutorial
  has been applied :
    com.acme.prime.upper.application
    com.acme.prime.upper.api
    com.acme.prime.upper.provider
 
  NOTE :
  Use the launchers of com.acme.prime.upper.application bundle to run the
  application
    
  The launcher to run or debug classically the application is :
    com.acme.prime.upper.bndrun
    (Run->Debug OSGi)
  
  The launcher to debug the application using the Apache-Felix Web-Console is :
    debug.bndrun
    (Run->Debug OSGi)

  *** WARNING :                                                                ***
  *** These two launchers must not be run simultaneously !!!                   ***
  *** i.e. if com.acme.prime.upper.bndrun is already running, its OSGi         ***
  *** framework  must be killed before an attempt to run debug.bndrun is made. ***
  *** The reciprocal is true.                                                  ***
   
  THIS EXPLANATION MUST BE VERIFIED :
  The reason is that it would seem that each session created for the the Jetty server
  of our application Web-Page will connect to the same local-host port.
  Remind that if we would attempt to re-launch our web application, having a previous
  one running (in its own VM), the new Jetty server would run in a new VM which
  implies that the previously Jetty session would still be active.
  Finally, such an attempt would result in Jetty conflicting to connect.
  The same problem seems to happen with an attempt to relaunch the
  Apache-Felix Web-Console while a previous application runs.
