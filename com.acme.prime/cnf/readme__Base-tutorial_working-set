  The "Base tutorial" working-set brings together the different OSGi bundle
  projects related to the eponymous OSGi-enRoute tutorial
################################################################################
  Description :
  
  In this tutorial we develop a little project that creates a simple server
  application that interacts with an OSGi console shell.
  
  - In the 'debug' phase of this tutorial (see section "Debugging") we will
    add the Apache-Felix Web-Console running in the OSGi framework.
    Especially XRay, a plugin from this web-console, is very useful because
    it let visualizes the OSGi services layer very well.
    Since we use dependencies, this plugin will automatically drag in the
    web console and the required Jetty web server.
    Once running in the framework, we can open XRay web-console with the
    web-browser, clicking :
      URL : http://localhost:8080/system/console/xray
    if we'are asked for credentials, type :
      User id: 	admin
      Password:	admin

  -- Section 3   --  API Project
  
  Related bundle project :
    com.acme.prime.eval.api
 
  NOTE :
  
  Let’s first define the contract for our API, this service contract is defined
  as an interface.
  
  ****************************************************************************
  *** Best practice is to give service contracts their own projects so     ***
  *** they can easily be shared.                                           ***                                          
  ****************************************************************************
    
  This is the purpose of the bundle com.acme.prime.eval.api
  
  An implementer of an API is a provider.
  However, providers of a service API can both implement and/or be a client
  of interfaces in the service package. A provider is responsible for providing
  the value of the contract, and a consumer receives the value of the contract.
 
  A consumer of an API is relatively distant from the contract and it often
  plays the role of a consumer in many different service contracts.
  A consumer of an API can expect backward compatibility.
   
  On the contrary, a provider of an API must fully implement a contract that has
  virtually no backward compatibility, because it is is extremely closely tied
  to the version of the API it provides. Any change in the version that affects
  the public API must result in rebuild of the provider’s bundle.
  Furthermore, a provider usually provides only a single service contact while
  being a consumer in other service contracts.
  
  Therefore the best practice in OSGi is for a provider to include its
  service API codes and export it. Separating the API from the provider makes
  no sense since there is a 1:1 relation between provider and API, unlike the
  consumer that will get backward compatibility from the API.
  Having the API in the bundle just makes life easier.
  That said, do not make the mistake to place them in the same project since
  that would require compiling against a JAR that would also contain the
  implementation.
  Compilation should always be done against API only JARs to prevent
  accidentally becoming dependent on implementation code.
  
  Consequently :
  ****************************************************************************
  *** Best practices dictate also that the provider should export its API  ***
  *** As a consequence, pure API projects must not be used in runtime      ***
  ****************************************************************************
  
  This is the reason why the bnd.bnd file of the API bundle (com.acme.prime.eval.api)
  has a 'compile-only' instruction :
    Require-Capability: compile-only
    
  Be mindful of how to influence the semantic versioning range for the provider(s)
  and for the consumer(s) of the contract with the use of @ProviderType and
  @ConsumerType annotations. The role of these annotations is explained in the
  "Export" paragraph in this section of the tutorial.
  To retrieve more explanations about the Provider & Consumer Types and about the
  rationale for setting the compile-only requirement in the MANIFEST of this bundle,
  consult :
    "OSGi in action" - chapter 5 - "Delving deeper into modularity"
    
  Remind that A bnd project is driven by the bnd.bnd file. This properties file
  defines the bnd instructions like the bundle version, the build path, which
  packages should go into the bundle, etc...
  Bndtools takes these informations and instructs Eclipse to act accordingly to
  assemble the bundle and synthesize the MANIFEST file.

  -- Section 4   --  Provider Project
  
  Related bundle project :
    com.acme.prime.eval.provider
    
  NOTE :
  Extract from the tutorial paragraph "Build Path" :
  ...
  Before being linked to the com.acme.prime.eval.api project, Eclipse cannot find
  the Eval class -> Hold your temptation to add this to the Eclipse Build Path
  because this will then fail later in the continuous integration where there is
  no Eclipse. Nope, we must add the dependency to bnd to get fidelity between our
  user friendly Eclipse world and the software engineering world of continuous
  integration.
    
  *** The dependencies of bnd are defined in the bnd.bnd file.     ***
 
  We can control the build path through the build path editor. Double click on
  the bnd.bnd file and select the Build tab.

  -- Section 6   --  Running Your Code
  
  Related bundle project :
    com.acme.prime.eval.provider
    
  NOTE :
  About the "Run requirements" paragraph :
  The exercise runs as planned when i add org.apache.felix.gogo.shell bundle in
  the 'run requirements' list.
  
  PROBLEM :
  I have also tried to use osgi.enroute.gogo.shell.provider instead but this shell
  terminates prematurely -> Exception... when debugging i found that the Shell object
  has no reference (null -> not instantiated).
  
  REMARK :
  when resolving while adding any one of these gogo shell bundle, some
  optional dependencies remains. I let them unresolved, this is sufficient for
  org.apache.felix.gogo.shell, but may be not for osgi.enroute.gogo.shell.provider.
  ...
  
  NOTE :
  About the "Updating" tutorial paragraph :
  Once the regular-expression of the eval method of EvalImpl class is updated, i.e.
  once the "*" and the "/" characters searches are added in the regex as additional
  operators to parse, a problem appears when inputting "*" as the operator.
  I debugged that the method works well, its regex pattern is good.
  I also discovered that for inputing the "*" character via the Apache Felix
  Gogo Shell, we must enter the sequence "\*" instead. Why ?
  Is there a need to configure Apache Felix Gogo Shell ?
  
  TODO :
  See doc of Apache Felix Gogo Shell

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  -- Section 8   --  Dependencies

  WARNING :
  All is OK until the "Playing" paragraph :
  I debugged that the Apache-Felix Gogo shell requires that some non-alphanumeric
  characters, but not all, be escaped. Its is notably the case for "*", "(", ")"
  For example :
    - expecting to input : test:eval 12*6
      we must input      : test:eval 12\*6
    - expecting to input : test:eval sin(pi)
      we must input      : test:eval sin\(pi\)
      ...
  Note that "+", "-", "\" do not need to be escaped
  
  Despite this slight disappointment with the shell, the exercises in this section
  passe successfully
  
  INFO :
  We could think that there is no more need to maintain com.scireum:parsii
  bundle in the build-path because we copied and embedded the two packages upon
  which our provider now depends, i.e. parsii.eval and parsii.tokenizer
  Apparently, these packages do not require any more external packages than what
  they can import from the java.*. Notice that the java.* need not to be added to
  the build-path because they are always available at in the JDK (and at runtime). 
  But what we have embedded are the binaries of these two packages, not their sources.
  Unfortunately, Eclipse can't find the classes from these packages at compile time.
  This is the reason why the bundle com.scireum:parsii needs effectively to be added
  to the build-path. 
  
  TODO :
  This explanation must be verified !!!

  -- Section 10  --  Deploying an Application
  
  Related bundle project :
    com.acme.prime.eval.application
  
  Extract from org.osgi.service.component.annotations.Reference javaDoc :
    ---
    @org.osgi.service.component.annotations.Reference
    
    @Target(value={FIELD, METHOD})
    @Retention(value=CLASS)
    Identify the annotated member as a reference of a Service Component.
    When the annotation is applied to a method, the method is the bind method of
    the reference. When the annotation is applied to a field, the field will
    contain the bound service(s) of the reference.
    This annotation is not processed at runtime by Service Component Runtime.
    It must be processed by tools and used to add a Component Description to the
    bundle.
    ...
    ---
    
  INFO :
  The code in package com.acme.prime.eval.application registers a service which
  name is "com.acme.prime.eval". The object offered by this new service is an
  instance of the com.acme.prime.eval.application.EvalApplication class.
  The @Component annotation on its class (EvalApplication), makes the
  Declarative-Service identifies this class as the implementation of the component.
  This service is registered as a dummy service that now provides the eval:eval
  command to Gogo shell.
    
  Furthermore we can notice that the EvalApplication encapsulates a method
  annotated by @org.osgi.service.component.annotations.Reference :
  if applied to a member (a field) of a class, this @Reference annotation can be
  used to identify this member as a reference of another Service Component.
  In our case, this annotation is applied to the method setEval(Eval eval) of
  our class EvalApplication, this makes this one the bind method of the reference.
  Finally, this makes the bounded other service be referenced by the (Eval) eval
  field of our class EvalApplication

  TODO : The above explanation must be verified  
  
  From tutorial paragraph "Defining the application" :
  At run time, inputting, say
    eval:eval 10+5
  with the Gogo shell, will induce a call to method eval of the service named
  "com.acme.prime.eval" which at its turn will make a call to method eval of
  the other bounded service named "com.acme.prime.eval.simple", passing to it
  the string "10+5" as an argument.
  Indeed, our "com.acme.prime.eval" service having dependency on service 
  "com.acme.prime.eval.simple", this last is also installed and run by the
  framework. As a consequence we can still input a Gogo command to it, like
    test:eval 5/2
      
  Remind that the service named "com.acme.prime.eval.simple" is provided by
  com.acme.prime.eval.provider
    
  The OSGi-template we used when first creating this *.application project was
  supposed to generate the code for a default web-page that would be served by
  an Apache Jetty web-server. Other related web resources were included, like
  Google-Angular and Twitter-Bootstrap.
  Furthermore, the template created in the project the hierarchical configuration
  and data related to serve this web-page, which it put in the 3 following
  directories : 
    configuration\
    static\
    web\
  The template also added to the -includeresource instruction included in the
  bnd.bnd file, three clauses to make the above mentioned web related resources
  and directories be included in the generated jar. These clauses are
    {configuration=configuration}, {static=static}, web=web
  But as our application doesn't need any web-page to be served, we can suppress
  these 3 clauses from the -includeresource bnd instruction.
  This has the effect of removing the above mentioned web-resources and
  web-directories from the content of the exported executable-jar of our
  *.application project.  
  Furthermore, as they become useless, and because we don't expect to re-use
  them in this application, these 3 directories can also be removed manually
  from the project structure. What i did.
  
  TODO :
  These suppressions must be validated

  INFO : 
  Gradle is a general-purpose build automation tool. It extends the usage patterns
  established by its forerunners Ant and Maven and allows builds that are expressive,
  maintainable, and easy to understand. Using a flexible Groovy-based DSL, Gradle
  provides declarative and extendible language elements that let you model your
  project's needs the way you want.
  
  WARNING :
  I have registered an account at github, given my username, my password, and
  my email address.
  For this exercise i created a github repository that i named com.acme.prime
  OK, but on my local disk, my com.acme.prime workspace was located under the
  following dir :
    ... \git\com.acme.prime\
  and the git\ dir is already the root of an old repository, where we can find
  some old demo projects :  
    ... \git\com.vogella.git.first\
    ... \git\gitmultiexample\
  I checked that the root .git directory is under this ... \git\ directory,
  making this last the repository to be considered for the creation of the
  github repo.
  
  So, the name i chosen for my github repo is not coherent with that hierarchy.
  In addition, the com.acme.prime workspace not being at the root, the Travis
  Continuous-Integration server will fail when trying to automatically build
  the projects because it cannot see an expected *.yml file at the root.
  
  TODO : This must be corrected !
  
  Despite this limitation, the 'clone' and 'push' of the repo works well.
